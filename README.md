Project Description
The most used method for compromising users globally is the phishing attack. Phishing links or websites are disseminated to target users through various channels, such as email and SMS. Some domains even host imitation login pages resembling the intended websites' legitimate login pages. Attempting to log in on these deceptive pages can compromise user login credentials and the potential download of malicious software onto their computers. This problem aims to detect such phishing domains among recently registered websites using publicly available databases, like the WHOIS Database, which provides a roster of newly registered domains.

The system uses the following techniques: 
-Backend code/content similarity in web pages.
-Web page image analysis (i.e., analysis between genuine and phishing site web page images; the more similarity, the better the probability score of being a lookalike phishing site).

The evaluation would be based on:
-Probability scores of phishing domains on their proximity to the genuine domain.
-Ability to detect new phishing domains in a reasonable time.
-Ease of use and flexibility of output formats.
